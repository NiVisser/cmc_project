Why should i care about thousands of slaves being killed to create infrastructure for soccer when in my home country of Australia we have been going through 4 years of the worst natural disasters in our countries history. In Australia from 2019-2020 we had the worlds largest fires ever, killing over 1 billion animals, endangering species that were never endangered, turning some extinct, destroying thousands of properties, killing many. From 2020-now we have been suffering the worsts floods in our countries history, with every single state suffering, millions of properties damaged, killing too many, drowning another cheeky billion animals and these flood are still ongoing. Our supermarkets regularly run out of staple food because crops get flooded, power outages shut down fridges.  So, why should i care about a game of soccer, it is barely in the top 10 most popular sports in my country with AFL, Cricket, Rugby, Netball, Surfing, Golf, V8 Super Cars and F1 are all much more popular in our country, its sad that people died for this, people die every day, people are dying daily in my country from natural disasters that have been happening for 3 years, not including the pandemic.

I agree, but in this specific point it is only about quatar.Abd pointing the finger to a country and saying ""Look, germany, same shit.""doesn't count here, because germany knows human rights and even migrant workers get rights that fit into german narration. My point is, its a known fact about the human rights violations since day one. Workers complain they have no food, no place to sleep, 80 workers share 2 sinks and 1 toilet, no showers. Some people simply die from living there. And when the guilty rich people start being accused, of course everybody of their friends jumps in to help them pointing the finger outwards. Thats why I say, all these deaths exsists statisticly, but most of them are BS twisted into ""it was their own fault""type of narrative. In germany you will never find a person that lives in their own shit, having to work 80hours a week and getting denied medical services and salary. You can take these statistics and be sure, there is some kind of honesty behind it when someone dies an natural cause in a country that has a healthy human rights record. But when it comes to such a rich people money sucking event, I would say, I do not beleve the statistics, because when I sleep 3 weeks in shit, I also could die. In that case I don't give a shit about faked statistics, because in these cases you can be sure that most if these natural causes of death were preventable. And twisting around words to aim the guilt away from the guilty is happening since the beginning of mankind. But to be clear. I do not beleve these statistics, because newsoutlets can only work with the information they get. Because they get their infos of bigger places, because they cannot go around and interview every single worker. So they get the infos from a centralized place. And when the statistics is provided by the quatari government, you can be 1000% sure, most of it is just BS. Thats not the fault of the reporters who report it.

As a result, they've had to move it to a winter competition, interfering with domestic football leagues all over the world. Kids are still in school and will miss most of the games.2) Qatar is a tiny country. Half the fun of World Cups is getting to travel all around a country, boosting tourism and showcasing your cities to the world. This also has the benefit of spreading out fans from more antagonistic countries. All of Qatars stadiums (the building of whichhaves been a well documented scandal) are within 50 miles of each other. The fans are all going to be on top of each other. 3) One of the appeals of going to a World Cup is the chance to party with people from all over the world. Qatar does not allow alcohol, despite Budwriset being a major sponsor. Sounds like a shit party. Theres plenty more reasons, but to be honest, i dont care enough anymore to write them out. Ireland haven’t even qualified, so there's even less incentive to watch even if I did want to support this corrupt, absolute abortion of a competition.",1668943750.0,3,[Comment(id='ix36djj')]
